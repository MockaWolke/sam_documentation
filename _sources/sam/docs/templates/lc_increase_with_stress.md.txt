# Impact of Additional Stress on Lethal Concentrations (LCs)

This page demonstrates how lethal concentrations (LCs) increase with added stress across different dose-response curves.

The first graphic illustrates, for each dose-response curve in our dataset, the increase in LC10 (left) and LC50 (right) values in response to additional stress as predicted by our SAM Model.

The second graphic provides a comparison of the observed (blue) and SAM-predicted (green) increases in LCs for all data samples subjected to additional stress.
